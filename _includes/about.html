          I am a Game Development graduate at Howest DAE, looking to start a career as gameplay programmer.
          Over the course of my school career, I became more and more interested in gameplay programming.
          This was especially reinforced during my internship at IDLab-MEDIA.
          Gameplay is at the core of any videogame, and I want to be part of the process that makes the mechanics to craft fun and exciting experiences.<br>
          Further below, you can read about some of my projects, take a look at my resume, and contact me.
