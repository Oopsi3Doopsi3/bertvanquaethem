description: "The final part of my education was an internship at <a href='https://media.idlab.ugent.be/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>IDLab-MEDIA</a>, which is a research group that is part of Ghent University and imec.<br><br>
Over the course of 18 weeks, I worked together with one other DAE student to develop a VR football recovery game. The game simulates a real-world football exercise, which requires the player engage in physical activity. The goal of the project is for physiotherapists to use this VR game during the rehabilitation process of someone with a knee injury to measure their progress.<br><br>
This entire period was a huge learning experience. I got to expand upon my Unity and C# skills, which I was already proficient in due to previous projects. Knowledge from previous courses such as gameplay programming came in very handy as well. But I also had to learn a lot of new topics that were never covered in previous courses, such as networking, VR, and motion trackers. These were all things I - in collaboration with my fellow student - had to figure out and learn myself in order to get the project working.<br><br>
Aside from technical skills, my soft skills were also greatly improved. Since we were in a team of just two, close collaboration was required to successfully complete the project, meaning good communication, planning, and being able to discuss differences of opinion and compromise. This was especially reinforced by our supervisor Prof. Glenn Van Wallendael. He oversees lots of other projects and people, which means he didn't always have time for us. As a result, we had to be independent, help each other out, and make decisions between the two of us.<br><br>
All in all, this was a great experience with lots of interesting topics and a great way to finish my DAE career.
