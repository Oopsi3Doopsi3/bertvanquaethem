description: "In Graphics Programming 2, we were taught the basics of the Vulkan API.
Everyone started with the same assignment; drawing a triangle. While this may sound simple, if you know anything of the Vulkan API, 
you'll know it's anything but. After getting the triangle, we could choose our direction, so I made a PBR shader. 
The process taught me a lot. It mainly taught me about being patient and not giving up, because as i previously mentioned, the Vulkan API is anything but simple 
and has a very steep learning curve. 
If you'd like to see some of the code, you can find the public Github repo <a href='https://github.com/Oopsi3Doopsi3/GP2_Vulkan' target='_blank'>here</a>."
