description: "For the course Gameplay Programming, we had to program the AI for an agent stuck in a zombie apocalypse. 
The map holds houses which can spawn loot (weapons, food, healing) which the agent can pick up and use to fight the zombies and obtain a high score. 
The agent behaviour got implemented through a behaviour tree, which I had a really enjoyable time implementing. 
Unfortunately, the Github repo is private, because it is managed by my school and I cannot change this."
