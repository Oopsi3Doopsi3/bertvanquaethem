course: "Programming 4"
description: "Programming 4 was a course mainly focused on engine programming.
Every student was assigned a classic arcade game to recreate and I got Galaga.
We got a very small codebase to start from, and from there we had to make our own engine to get to the desired end result.
This taught us all about engine basics, from the gameplay loop and gameobject-component systems to observers and event systems.
Next to engine basics, we also learned a lot of C++ best practices and guidelines, mostly coming from Guy Davidson's \"Beautiful C++\".
If you'd like to see some of the code, you can find the public Github repo <a href='https://github.com/Oopsi3Doopsi3/Prog4-Engine' target='_blank'>here</a>."
