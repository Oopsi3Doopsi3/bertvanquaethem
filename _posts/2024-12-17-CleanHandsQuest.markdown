description: "During the first semester of my last year at DAE, I had the course <i>Group Projects</i>. This was another group project in collaboration with the other majors, only this time we worked on the game four days a week for twelve weeks.<br><br>
My group and I worked together with the national <i>Hand Hygiene Workgroup</i>, that wanted to make a game that teaches and raises awareness about hand hygiene among hospital staff. This would be deployed during their campaign on the national hand hygiene day.<br><br>
The combination of what the client wanted and the target group associated with it gave us a real challenge when designing the game. Eventually though, we came up with a detective-style game. The player is in a hospital where a patient has been infected due to an error in hand hygiene procedure by one of the staff members. It is now up to them to figure out who made the mistake and what exactly went wrong.<br><br>
The game was made in Unity with C#. This was my first big project in Unity and gave me valuable insight into the workings of the engine. It was also one of my few projects made in C#, but that didn't give me any issues because I had prior experience with C++.<br><br>
The workflow was much the same as during the previous group work, just on a bigger scale. Perforce was used again as source control software, and HacknPlan as planning software."
