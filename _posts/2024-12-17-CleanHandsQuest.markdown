description: "This is the project I'm currently working on. One of the final courses in the school curriculum is a group project together with the other majors. 
My group and I work for the national Hand Hygiene Workgroup, who want a game to teach hand hygiene to medical staff of a hospital. 
We are working on a detective-style game in Unity, and are expected to have finished by the ende of the year. 
For now, there is no way to play/look at it yet, but once we have launched, I will update this page."
