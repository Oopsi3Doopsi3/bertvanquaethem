description: "In Graphics Programming 1, we first saw the basics of graphics programming and had to make our own raytracer and rasterizer. 
After learning the basics, we moved over to using the popular DirectX 11 API. In this API, we had to make a PBR shader. 
This was my first introduction to graphics programming, and I find it really interesting (albeit also very difficult) and amazing what we can do with a couple of lines of code. 
If you'd like to see some of the code, you can find the public Github repo <a href='https://github.com/Oopsi3Doopsi3/GP1_DirectX_Starter' target='_blank'>here</a>."
